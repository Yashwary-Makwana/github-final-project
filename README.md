# Simple Interest Calculator

## Purpose
This project calculates simple interest using the formula: **I = (P × R × T) / 100**

## Formula

Simple Interest (I) = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

## Usage Examples
- Principal: $1000, Rate: 5%, Time: 2 years → I = $100
- Principal: $5000, Rate: 3.5%, Time: 3 years → I = $525

## Inputs Required
- **Principal (P)**: Initial amount
- **Rate (R)**: Annual interest rate (%)
- **Time (T)**: Time period (years)
